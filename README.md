DO NOT copy and paste code from the internet
DO NOT cheat with other students, I am trusting you all for this one!
Once you have finished with the test, make a video recording your computer screen (via phone or a software like OBS/screencastify etc) and explaining how you have approached the problem in code and showing the final product. The video can be UPTO 3 mins long. Please donâ€™t record videos longer than that.
Upload the code to github.
